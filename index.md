#### School Districts

This is an interactive map that shows, by School District, the percent of public schools with fiber connectivity sized by number of students. It does not show what percent of schools within a district actually subscribe to high-speed fiber. The universe of public schools is defined using 2011-2012 NCES Public School Data available at [http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp). 

Connectivity status is compiled from data from the National Broadband Map (June 2013) and data submitted to the FCC in WC Docket Number 13-184 and posted at [http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/E-rate-modernization-data](http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/E-rate-modernization-data). Fiber connectivity is determined from either notation of "fiber" as the specific connection technology (at any speed) or a connection speed of at least 100 Mbps.

#### About

On July 23, 2014, the Wireline Competition Bureau initiated a thorough review of the E-rate program (more formally known as the schools and libraries universal service support mechanism). When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorizing the creation of the E-rate program, only 14 percent of classrooms had access to the Internet, and most schools with access (74 percent) used dial-up connections. By 2005 nearly all schools had access to the Internet. 

Increasingly, schools and libraries require high-capacity broadband connections to take advantage of digital learning technologies that hold the promise of substantially improving educational experiences and expanding opportunity for students, teachers, parents and whole communities. In an effort to understand the current state of fiber connectivity to schools and libraries eligible for E-rate support, the FCC seeks further community engagement to refine this map as well as a companion map on connectivity to libraries which can be found by selecting the School Districts / Libraries tab on the map selector above.

We recognize that the current version of this map only identifies connectivity to public school districts.  We intend to augment it with information about fiber connectivity to private and parochial schools that are eligible for E-rate support. 

#### Community Engagement

Can you help improve the data that drives this map?  The Commission has asked for comment to help identify the gap between schools' and libraries' current connectivity and the specific connectivity targets the Commission adopted in its E-Rate Modernization Order.  Can you help by providing a district or school name that is not identified?  A school's NCES ID (found at [http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/](http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/))?  An individual school's connection technology (e.g., fiber, cable, T-1, wireless) or advertised download speed?  

Please submit your comments, which will be included in WC Docket Number 13-184, to [schoolfibermap@fcc.gov](schoolfibermap@fcc.gov).

#### Libraries

This is an interactive map that shows which public libraries (central and branch) are connected to fiber. It does not show what percent of libraries actually subscribe to high-speed fiber. The universe of public libraries is defined using the 2011-2012 IMLS Public Libraries Survey available from [http://www.imls.gov/research/pls_data_files.aspx](http://www.imls.gov/research/pls_data_files.aspx). 

Connectivity status is compiled from data from the National Broadband Map (June 2013) and data submitted to the FCC in WC Docket Number 13-184 and posted at [http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/E-rate-modernization-data](http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/E-rate-modernization-data).
